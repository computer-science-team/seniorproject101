universitydownload and universitydownload2 are both working. Minor changes were made to universitydownload. universitydownload2 now works for clubs. If file is not available for download a message will be displayed on profile page. Neither page asks for university. The university id is read in now. Additionally, the download page does not show. If a file is available and the List of Ides is clicked the file will be downoladed.

universityupload and universityupload2. The page no longer asks for university name to upload the file. The university is now read in. If a file is already on the server a message will be shown indicating that a file is available and if a new file is uploaded then the old one will be replaced.

signup page has been modified to allow any user to add a university. Once a user submit his/her info the university is added.
